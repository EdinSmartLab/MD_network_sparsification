# MD_network_sparsification

This is a repository containing MATLAB codes and figures for the paper entitled, "Sparsification of long range force networks for molecular dynamics simulations", submitted to PLOS ONE. Please cite this work when using the codes. 

Codes: Contains all the codes for generating figures in the paper. Codes/PLOS_Fig1_plot.m : Generates full, thresholded and sparsified graphs for all the analysis in the paper (figure 1 of paper).

MATLAB_fig_files: Contains supplementary matlab figure files for analysis. MATLAB_fig_files/figure2new_a.fig and figure2new_b.fig: Contains the data of net force and normalized error evaluation (figure 2 of paper). Use main_data_extracted.m for extracting data from matlab figures.
